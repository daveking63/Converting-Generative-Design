<h1>Converting Generative Design</h1>
<p>
In 2012 Hartmut Bohnacker, Benedikt Gross, Julia Laub, and Claudius Lazzeroni (ed.) published a massive volume of generative art programs entitled <a href=" "><i>Generative Design: Visualize, Program, and Create with Processing</i></h> (Princeton Architectural Press). As the subtitle notes, the programs are based on a language called <a href="https://processing.org/"><strong>Processing</strong></a> (version 2.0).

Off and on over the past year, I have spent a bit of spare time converting many of these programs to Javascript with a new language called <a href=" "><strong>p5.js</strong></a>. The differences between Processing and p5.js are that: (1) p5.js runs natively on the Web while Processing doesn't; but (2) Processing has been around for much longer and is much more extensive. Consequently, some of the programs in the book cannot be converted because p5.js versions of various libraries don't exist and unlike Processing it has minimal support for 3D.
